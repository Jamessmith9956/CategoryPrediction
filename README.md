Analyse a [dataset](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1IxCF-QLFi02knTmUYllnPgedZNzXT_hy?usp=sharing) with a column called description, which is the POS stamp for the transaction, and two other columns for Category and Sub Category. 
Use a notebook of your choice (Jupyter, Google, etc.) and preferably Python as a coding language, to answer the following questions:

1. Given the transaction details columns, can you build a simple model that reads a portion of this data, and without seeing the hold out set, predicts the categories and subcategories? first start by predicting the category and see if you can expand.

2. Can you also build a model which takes in a whole new transaction description (none of those that your model has seen for training and testing), and gives the closest possible category?
